# Bim - A Bad IMitation of Vi(m)

![screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

Bim is a terminal text editor with syntax highlighting.

Inspired by Vim and featuring similar mode-based editing, Bim was originally written for ToaruOS, but it has also been tested in Linux, Sortix, FreeBSD, and macOS.

## Goals / Purpose

Bim is intended as the included text editor in ToaruOS, a hobby operating system built from scratch.

Bim aims to be lightweight and featureful with no external dependencies, providing a modern editing experience in a single fully-encapsulated binary.

## Features

- Vim-like modal interactions.
- Arrow-key and traditional vi `hjkl` navigation.
- Syntax highlighting (currently for C/C++, Python, Makefiles, Java, Rust, and a few others).
- Themes, including 256-color and 24-bit color support.
- Indentation adjustment and na√Øve automatic indentation.
- Multiple editor tabs.
- Basic Unicode support (sufficient for things like Japanese, but not capable of more complex scripts).
- Efficient screen redrawing.
- Terminal support tested in ToaruOS, Sortix, xterm, urxvt, Gnome, XFCE, Linux and FreeBSD consoles, macOS Terminal.app, iTerm2.
- Mouse support in Xterm-like terminals.
- Line and character selection, with yanking (paste buffer).
- Incremental forward and backward search with match highlighting and smart case sensitivity.
- Undo/redo stack.
- Highlight matching parens/braces.
- Multi-line insert mode.
- Persistent cursor location between sessions.
- Git integration, shows `git diff` status in-line, along with unsaved changes.
- Convert syntax highlighted code to an HTML document.
- (experimental) Split viewports to view multiple files or different parts of the same file.

## Prerequisites

Bim has no external dependencies beyond a functioning C library, C99 compiler, and sufficient escape code support in the hosting terminal.

### Terminal Support

Unicode support is recommended, but not completely required. Most terminals support the handful of characters used in the default setup regardless, but use `-O nounicode` if you experience issues with the rendering of tabs.

256-color and 24-bit color are optional. The default theme uses only the standard 16 colors. If your terminal only supports 8 colors, you can also supply `-O nobright` to disable bright colors.

Scrolling is normally done through `^[[1S` and `^[[1T`. If your terminal doesn't support these escapes, or has trouble scrolling, supply `-O noscroll` to have the screen refresh when scrolling. This may be slow.

Mouse support with `^[[?1000h` is available; if this escape sequence causes issues in your terminal, use `-O nomouse`.

The alternate screen is used if available with `^[[?1049h`. This can be disabled with `-O noaltscreen`.

## Additional Bim Functionality

You can use Bim to display files in your terminal with syntax highlighting with `bim -c` (no line numbers) and `bim -C` (with line numbers).

![screenshot](docs/screenshot_cat.png)

You can pipe text to bim for editing with `bim -`. Note that Bim will wait for end-of-file before launching, so this is not suitable for use as a pager (pager support is planned).

## Themes

Bim includes a handful of color schemes for the interface and syntax highlighting.

### ANSI

The default 16-color theme. Can be configured for use on terminals with or without bright color support. Looks a bit like Irssi.

![ansi](docs/theme_ansi.png)

### Sunsmoke

An original 24-bit color theme with rustic browns and subdued pastel colors.

![sunsmoke](docs/screenshot.png)

### Sunsmoke-256

A 256-color version of Sunsmoke for use in terminals that do not support 24-bit color.

![sunsmoke256](docs/theme_sunsmoke256.png)

### Wombat

A 256-color theme based on the theme of the same name for Vim.

![wombat](docs/theme_wombat.png)

### Solarized Dark

A 24-bit color theme based on the popular color palette.

![solarized-dark](docs/theme_solarized-dark.png)

### City Lights

A 24-bit color theme based on the one for Atom and Sublime, featuring low contrast blues.

![citylights](docs/theme_citylights.png)

## Config File

You can set the default theme in `~/.bimrc`:

    # set a color theme, sunsmoke is a 24-bit theme
    theme=sunsmoke
    # set a scroll offset so the cursor isn't at the bottom or top of the screen
    padding=4

## Syntax Support

Not all syntax highlighters are complete or support all features of their respective languages.

- C/C++
- Python
- Java
- diffs
- Generic INI-style config files
- Rust
- git commits and interactive rebase
- Make / GNU Make
- Markdown (with some inline code highlighting support)
- JSON
- XML / HTML
- Protobuf
- Bash

## Why is Bim a single ~10k line source file?

Bim was designed to be the included text editor in ToaruOS, and ToaruOS's build system was designed to have a single source file for each application binary.
For the vast majority of applications in ToaruOS, this limitation is entirely reasonable.
Bim is by far the largest application in the OS; the window compositor comes in second at a much smaller ~3000 lines.
As Bim has grown, the question has come up several times as to whether it should be broken up into logical units in separate files, but being a single large file still has its benefits.

## License

Bim is released under the terms of the ISC license, which is a simple BSD-style license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## Development

Bim is still primarily developed alongside ToaruOS. This repository is a mirror with fake history going back to the start of that project. Pull requests merged here will be patched into [ToaruOS](https://git.toaruos.org/klange/toaruos).
